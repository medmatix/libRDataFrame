@brief  The categoryType creates and provides utilities for a categorical or factor
datatype (similar to R's factor type). The utilies allow construction, and
population of data type based a vector of factors. There are also functions
included to convert factor variables to and from int and string variable
collections.

The best model to use was considered to be the open source R factor type.
In Addition to constructors, utilities to manipulate this variable type are needed.
