
get the utilCSV::strDStruct (a vector of vectors of strings)

create a vector of nodes (j = ncols node)

create a vector of strings 

PopulateNode:
	create a node[j]

	

	populate vector of strings from column j of strDStruct rows vectors

	clone vector of strinngs (to new memory address)

	assign cloned vector of strings pointer to Node ptrData pointer

	add node to vector(node) at position [j]

	clear vector of strings

increase j (if not = ncol) and do PopulateNode again 

when done return new df
